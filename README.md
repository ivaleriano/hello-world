About me
I love reading and creative writing! My favorite books include Rayuela by Cortázar, 100 Years of Solitude by García Márquez, Blindness by Saramago, A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf, among others. 
The extracurricular activities I am the most passionate about are community service, coding, and writing.
